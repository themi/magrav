* Use Ag GANS and Au GANS to cause a plasmatic flow (as opposed to Lead Pb)
* Cu GANS is in tune with body, Zn GANS is in tune with nervous system, CO2 GANS is in tune with "emotion" 
* Examples of elements atomic mass that are in ratio to each other
  - CO2*2 (12*2)=24, now consider that Al=26
  - Zn*2 (65*2)=130, is somewhere between Sn (Tin)=118 and Au (gold)=196 (eg. iodine=127)
  - Cu*2 (53*2)=106, now consider that Ag=107
