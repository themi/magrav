#### t=1h7m0s
* Producing lift
  - Perpendicular Coils 
    - Nanocoat + GANS coat to include (CUO2 or stronger)
  - center GANS Reactor 
    - 80%   CH3 and CO2
    - 19.9% H  (aluminium placed into liquid caustic will give off hydrogen)
    - 0.1%  Pb (Paint it on the bottom of reactor inside or outside)

> EXTREME CAUTION: Donot directly handle Pb GANS in both production and application - especially vapour of lead!  
> Reason: Lead (Pb GANS) and Zinc (CO2 GANS) are connected by structure and considered opposites  
> CO2 GANS lifts you (spiritually), where as pB GANS push you down (spiritually)


#### t=1h14m50s
* stacker flow using a "sink"
  - plasma bty -> MagGrav [-> load] -> plasma sink [-> loop back to plasma bty]
  - sink is a simple capactior, using pB GANS paper and outer coil is wound CLOCK-WISE
  - IMPORTANT: flow from sink must not return back to sink, must only flow out (when connecting back to source bty)  Possibly try a Alekz bead to act as a diode


#### t=1h38m0s
* Alekz bead system explained [Plasma Battery]
  - nanocoated (NC) Copper wire
  - roll paper, coated with dry GANS, around the NC Copper wire
  - roll zinc (or aluminium) around that - zinc must not touch the central copper wire.

#### t=2h6m0s
  * replace capacitors of stacker unit with Alekz beads system 
    - this will reduce power consumption by 60-100%
    - put the beads in as the bottom tray instead of coils (2 layers of flat coils)


* include a diode with your sink bty:
  - diode (-ve) end has feedback loop + loop to (+ve) pole


#### t=2h24m30s



# DANGER
* When on grid NEVER connect ALEKZ beads in series! 


#### t=4h03m0s

* Nanocoating or Graphene?
