* device to increase pH of water
  - nano-coat a water hose and spiral into a coil around a nano-coated copper tube
  - insulate device (nano-coating) from human touch


pH | mV | description
---|---|
0 | +400mV | Acidic
7 | 0 | Neutral
14| -400mV | Alkaline


mV | Body state
---|---
-50mV | healing
-20mV | normal operation
-15mV | tired
-6mV | sick
-5mV | organs stop functioning
-0mV | prone to infection
+5mV | pain
+10mV | lack of oxygen
+15mV | viral infection
+20mV | bacterial infection
+25mV | fungal infection
+30mV | existence of cancel cells

##### NOTE: 
* When mV is positive (reverse polarity) cells are actively being damaged
* Measure each accupuncture meridian and average result
