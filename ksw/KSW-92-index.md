#### t=38m16m
* power unit and star config combination can become lift  (coils donot need to be rotated like reactors)

* varying GANS strength per coil layer

CuZn/CO2 1:1
CuZn/CO2 1:1
CuZn/CO2 2:1

Ag/CuZn 2:1
Ag/CuZn 3:1
Ag/CuZn 3:1


#### t=1h42m30s
* a control mechanism of plasma strength 

#### t=2h4m42s
* add split capacitors to feed back plasma to source/coils 

#### t=3h14m46s
* fields of plasma never disconnect so careful about sharing.  [hmmm communication device?]
