#### t=1h18m
* CH3 and PbO GANS to make shielding

#### t=2h24m
##### Creating plasma using Copper 
* Magnetical goes out anti-clockwise
* Gravitational comes in clockwise 

##### Creating plasma using (GANS) water 
* Magnetical
  - CH3
  - CO2
  - CuO
* Gravitaional
  - Pb Gans

#### t=2h43m
* Personalise your plasma device with your body oils (amino acid).
  - 1. Clean parts with hot (boiling) caustic bath.
  - 2. Handling parts without gloves will contaminate parts with your amino acid.
  - 3. When producing Co2 GANS, allow the amnio acid (collecting on the surface) to contaminate the GANS.

* Personalise your plasma device with your blood.
  - 1. Clean parts with hot (boiling) caustic bath.
  - 2. Make GANS of your blood (red blood plasma) and your lymph (white blood plasma)
  - 3. Add (your) GANS water to inner ring gravitational
  - 4. Add (your) GANS water to outer ring magnetical
  - IMPORTANT: Add a tiny amount of CuO to those parts as well to prevent infections developing in the amnio acids.
