#### t=0h49m30s
* Ali: explains lift config

#### t=0h56m0s
* Keshe: Cors produce the plasma layering similar to magrav coils
  - Layer 0: Copper wire (conduit only)
  - Layer 1: Nano-coating
  - Layer 2: CUO GANS
  - Layer 3: CO2 GANS
  - Layer 4: CH3 GANS


#### t=1h11m30s
* To make H GANS either:
  - Mix Aluminium with Caustic produces H, or
  - Make the last layer of GANS coating CH3

* coil connections:
  - inner coil grav connected to outer coil grav
  - outer coil mag keep separate from inner coil mag

> This enables you to connect the ends as required and dynamically to produce different effects needed for flight

#### t=1h23m55s
* Keshe explains layout of ship 


#### t=1h34m0s
* Phillipines invoation centre present of their flight system


#### t=1h48m0s
* Ali:
- Must fire nanocaot copper for the flight system
- Coils (only) have a final coating with amino acid
- Base (tetrahedon) cores have diff first layer (eg. Fe -> Al -> Cu)

* Sacred Cubit Length: 20.6 inch = 523.24mm

#### t=2h3m44s
* Japan: Describes a tool to measure magnetic fields of objects
  - Uses a device that monitors a crystall

Sodium (Na)    11 / 23  
Americium (Am) 95 / 243  
Bismuth (Bi)   83 / 209  
Iron (fe)      26 / 56
