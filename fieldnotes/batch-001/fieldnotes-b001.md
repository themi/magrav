- GaNS is now a runny paste - placed lids on for storage. (photo: 20151123-GaNS-storage)

# Thurs 19 Nov 2015
- 09:00 Green/blue colour dust is now settling on top of the orange/red dust, I am now refereing to the dust, of any colour, GANS.
- 18:00 Extract, with sringe, as much GANS as possible and place into smaller container for rinsing (Photo: 20151119-1st-GANS)
- 20:00 Using same plates in same water adding 1.5v battery between plates and pumping air into the water. (Photo: 20151119-battery-and-pump)
- 20:30 Green colour appearing in water (Photo: 20151119-still-harvesting)
- 09:00 Scoop up GaNS (with siringe) store in small containers. Rinsed with distilled water 2/3 times. Extract as much water as possible, then left container open to allow evapouration. (photo: 20151119-cleaned-evapourating)

- 09:00 Allow to sit with wires only connected to each plate

# Tue 17 Nov 2015
- 06:00 - Water is nolonger crystal clear.  There is some, (what appears to be a) white substance developing, its very faint at this point but something is definately happening in there.
- 08:30 - Connected AA battery, push (+ve) to brass plate, pull (-ve) to nanocoated copper.
- 09:30 - Heavy concentration of orange/yellow "dust" accumulating in the bottom of container. (photo: 20151117-add_bty)
- 12:00 - Scum developing on surface of lquid. (photo: 20151117-scum-developing)
- 14:00 - disconnecting AA bty, need to aquire oxygen pump to aerate water. Colour should be green/blue not orange/red

# Mon 16 Nov 2015
- 14:00 - Prepare GANS harvest container and plates, arrange the plates so they are suspended approx 5mm from the bottom of the container and away from the walls. Rinse nancoated copper with distilled water and air dry for 1 hours then add 15% saltwater/distilled water mix to the container with plates connected by wire.

- 14:30 - The water is very clear (Photo: 20151116-start_harvest)

- 06:00 - Beginning the drying process. Set volt meter 200m DCV and drained charge for 10-15 sec. Red terminal to plate, black terminal to mesh, the reading fluctuated rapidly. Bleed charge 3 times/day (Photo: 20151111-drying)

# Tues 10 Nov 2015
- 08:00 - All of the copper is now black, some areas bit more so than others. 
- 09:00 - Started first caustic steam bath.

# Mon 9 Nov 2015
- 07:00 - Copper wires and plate are developing a dark black colour its patchy but definately taking hold.
- 09:00 - Moved container onto balconey - the container got about a hour of direct sunlight. 
- 15:00 - Copper wires and plate are developing more dark black colour.  Wires are almost all black, on the plate the dark colour is creeping over to entire area.

# Sun 8 Nov 2015
- 15:00 - Copper doesnt appear to be changing much, drained off enough liquid so that copper materials would not be covered by liquid. Rinse copper in cold tap water before placing back in container.  I going to leave for another 24 hrs before attempting caustic steaming.

# Sat 7 Nov 2015
- 15:00 Placed a 150x150x1mm copper plate and 4 short lengths of copper wire into plastic container on top of wire mesh. Added generous amount of caustic soda and 2.5 litres of boiling tap water and covered container. The liquid covered all materials by at least an inch.

- Noticed a plastic film on one side of the coppper - run hot over it and pealed it off  (Photo: 20151107-startup_kit)
