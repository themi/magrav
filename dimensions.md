## Formula Notes

diameter of torus: (t9 * (d + g)) / pi
length of wire: (i + d/2) * pi * t

##### Where:
* t = turn constant
* d = wire diameter
* g = gap between turns
* pi = 3.14
* i = inner diamter of coiled wired

12 - 1.5 = 10.5 / 5.25
8 - 1.5 = 6.5 / 3.25

#### Coil Dimensions

 
* 126
  - ((14 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 80.25477707 R40.127388535
  - length of wire:
    - outer grav: (5 + (1.5/2)) * 3.14 * 126 = 2274.93mm
    - outer mag: (9 + (1.5/2)) * 3.14 * 126 = 3857.49mm

* 81 
  - ((9 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 51.592356688 R25.796178344
  - ((9 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.635))/3.14 = 55.074840764 R27.537420382
  - length of wire:
    - inner grav: (5 + (1.5/2)) * 3.14 * 81 = 1462.455mm
    - inner mag: (9 + (1.5/2)) * 3.14 * 81 = 2479.815mm
