## Formula Notes

(t9 * (d + g)) / pi

##### Where:
* t = turn constant
* d = wire diameter
* g = gap between turns
* pi = 3.14

12 - 1.5 = 10.5 / 5.25
8 - 1.5 = 6.5 / 3.25

#### Variation on outer (mag) coils 

* 126
  - ((14 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 80.25477707 R40.127388535 
  - (81 * (0.5 + 0.25))/3.14

* 135
  - ((15 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 85.987261146 R42.993630573 

* 144
  - ((16 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 91.719745223 R45.859872612

* 81
  - ((9 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.5))/3.14 = 51.592356688 R25.796178344
  - ((9 * 9) * (1.5 + 0.635))/3.14 = 55.074840764 R27.537420382
