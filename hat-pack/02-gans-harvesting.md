## GaNS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce GaNS.  GaNS is needed to coat Mag/Grav coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central power source for completed Mag/Grav coil sets.  

### Ingredients
* Nanocoated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* saltwater (or seawater)
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure

* Place in plates
  - suspend each plate from opposite walls of container

* Attach wires

* Join each wire to each other

* Prepare and add saltwater.
  - Make from distilled (demineralised) water and natural upprocessed salt.
  - %15 (or 145 grams) of salt to 1 Ltr of water

* run for 4-7 days

#### faster production

* connect a 1.5V.
  - Connect (+) of battery to the brass plate.  
  - Connect (-) of battery to the nanocoated copper plate.

* add air pump
  - oxygen is important in the GaNS process, GaNS colour will be bright turquiose in colour when oxygen is present.
  - GaNS will be brown in colour when there is insufficent enough oxigen present in water.

* run for 6-8 hours

#### Harvest

* Siringe the GaNS 
  - put the siringe tip into the GaNS at the bottom of the container and extend the siringe to suck up the material.
  - place into the rinsing container

* let the GaNs settle

* Siringe out the water
  - remove the water from the rinsing container

* Add distilled water
  - now refill the rinsing container with distilled water

* repeat rinsing 2-3 times.

* dry the GaNS
  - place GaNS into storage container
  - leave lid off  for 2/3 days (place under a heat lamp to make it fry faster)
 
* Store it
  - once GaNS is the consitency of running paste, replace lid and store for later use.

#### Go again

Depending on the size of your plates you can rerun again 1 or 2 times.  When the water becomes unusually misty, then swap out the plates for a new set. 


## Summary

You will need a min of 600ml+ of GaNS before you start making your power unit, I recommend that you keep producing GaNS right up to point where you complete your power unit to ensure you have sufficient quantity. 

May the plasma be with you.
