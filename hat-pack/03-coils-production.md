## Coils production

The purpose of this step is to construct the power unit coils and capactors.

### Ingredients
* Bare copper wire (about 1kg) 
  - AWG14/SWG16 (1.5 - 1.6mm dia)
  - AWG18/SWG19 (1.0mm dia) for mini set
* Pliers and sidecutters
* Electric hand drill - optional
* mandrels: 
  - 5mm, 9mm for large set
  - 3mm, 5mm for mini set
* Materials to nano-coat the copper wire
* GANS (CuO2, CO2, CH3)


### Key dimensions
#### Outer Magnetic (1.5mm dia wire, 9mm mandrel)
* Wire needed: 4747.68mm
* No of turns (around mandrel): 126
* allow 30-50mm before, and 
* allow 30-50mm after the coiling 

#### Inner Magnetic (1.5mm dia wire, 5.5mm mandrel)
* wire needed: 3362.94mm
* no of turns (around mandrel): 126
* allow 30-50mm before, and 
* allow 280mm after the coiling 

#### Outer Gravitational (1.5mm dia wire, 9mm mandrel)
* Wire needed: 3052.08mm
* No of turns (around mandrel): 81
* allow 30-50mm before, and 
* allow 30-50mm after the coiling 

#### Inner Gravitational (1.5mm dia wire, 5.5mm mandrel)
* Wire needed: 2161.89mm
* No of turns (around mandrel): 81
* allow 30-50mm before, and
