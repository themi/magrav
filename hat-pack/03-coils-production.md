## Coils production

The purpose of this step is to construct the power unit coils and capactors.

### Ingredients
* Bare copper wire (about 1kg) 
  - AWG14 (1.6mm dia)
* Pliers and sidecutters
* Electric hand drill - optional
* mandrels: 
  - gravitational set: 5.5mm
  - magnetical set: 9mm

### Procedure
* Dimensions
* Windings
* Coiling and connections

#### 1. Dimensions
* 144 turns
  - Diameter/Radius: (144 * (1.626 + 0.8))/3.14 = 111.256050955 R55.628025478
  - length of wire:
    - outer grav: (5.5 + (1.626*2)) * 3.14 * 144 = 3957.30432
    - outer mag: (9 + (1.626*2)) * 3.14 * 144 = 5539.86432
  - circumference:
    - no gap: 144 * 1.626 = 234.144
    - with gap: 144 * (1.626 + 0.8) = 349.344

* 81 turns
  - Diameter/Radius: (81 * (1.626 + 0.8))/3.14 = 62.581528662 R31.290764331
  - length of wire:
    - outer grav: (5.5 + (1.626*2)) * 3.14 * 81 = 2225.98368
    - outer mag: (9 + (1.626*2)) * 3.14 * 81 = 3116.17368
  - circumference:
    - 81 * 1.626 = 131.706
    - 81 * (1.626 + 0.8) = 196.506

#### 2. Windings

You require 4 coils: 

Coil | Mandrel size | Turns | Direction | Total wire length | Coil length w gap | extra length
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Outer Magnetical | 9mm| 144  | clockwise | 5539.86432mm | 349.344mm | no
Outer Gravitational | 5.5mm | 144 | anti-clockwise | 3957.30432mm | 349.344 | 349.344mm
Inner Magnetical | 9mm | 81 | clockwise | 3116.17368mm | 196.506mm | no
Inner Gravitational | 5.5mm | 81 | anti-clockwise | 2225.98368mm | 196.506 | 196.506mm

Secure the mandrel in the drill chuck.

Push an end of the copper wire in between the chuck grips/teeth to hold it in place.

Set drill direction according to table above.

Turn on the drill and guide the wire onto the mandrel so it coils neatly - stop when number of turns reached.

Stretch the coils, while still on the mendrel so there is an even gap between each turn (about 0.8mm)

Cut the wire leaving 100mm for connections plus 'extra length' as per table above.


#### 3. Coiling and connections

Place the smaller coil inside the larger coil, then feed the 'extra length' back inside the smaller coil.

Arrange the coils so that the 'extra length' comes from the left side and feeds back inside itself in a clockwise direction.




### Summary

May the plasma be with you.
