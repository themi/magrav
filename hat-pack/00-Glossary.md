#### Brass plate
> Brass is a metal alloy made of copper and zinc.  Brass plates are used as cathodes in the production of GANS.

#### Copper plate
> Brass is a metal alloy made of copper and zinc.  (Nanocoated) copper plates are used as anodes in the production of GANS.

#### Anode
> An anode is an electrode through which conventional current flows into a device.

#### Cathode
> A cathode is an electrode through which conventional current flows out of a device.

#### Magrav
> Magnetic and gravitational fields (Magnetic referring to the plasma of magnetic fields created by a dynamic entity as for example this refers to the magnetic field of the earth)

#### Nano coating
> A coating whose thickness is measured on the nano scale.  Nano coating is the result of an application where nano structures build a consistent network of molecules on a surface. 

#### GANS
> a new state of matter; a molecule of a gas (GAs) which becomes Nano of itself and appears as Solid state of matter. GAs to Nano of Solid and to be called GANS for short.

#### Tin snips
> Snips, also known as shears, are hand tools used to cut sheet metal and other tough webs. There are two broad categories: tinner's snips, which are similar to common scissors, and compound-action snips, which use a compound leverage handle system to increase the mechanical advantage.

#### Caustic soda
> also known as lye. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is used in many industries, mostly as a strong chemical base in the manufacture of pulp and paper, textiles, drinking water, soaps and detergents and as a drain cleaner.

#### Distilled
> purify (a liquid) by heating it so that it vaporizes, then cooling and condensing the vapour and collecting the resulting liquid.  Also known as: "Deminerialised"

#### Voltmeter
> A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter.

#### Power Unit
> Keshe Foundation Magrav Power Unit.  A unit created from nanocoated copper wire (coils) and GANS that when connected to a power source produce plasma energy.
