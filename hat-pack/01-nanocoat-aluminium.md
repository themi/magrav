## Nanocoat Aluminium foil/sheets

The purpose of this step is to prepare aluminium foil for use in plasma batteries.

### Ingredients
  - Aluminium foil/sheet
  - caustic soda 
  - seawater
  - sulphur powder (optional)
  - large container for the mixing process (glass or plastic)
  - storage container for the solution (glass or plastic)
  - voltmeter
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* Method 1: Hotwater/Caustic

## Method 1: Hotwater/Caustic
* 30g caustic/7.5 litres water (4g caustic/1 litre hot water)

Mix caustic and hot water, place aluminium into liquid and leave for 30-60min

Dilute with more hot water if aluminium is being eroded.

## Summary
Test the aluminium with multimeter set to 200 Ohms - reading should register no resistance (1 or 0L depends on meter type). 

Test with multimeter set to 200mV DC, reading will not be steady, it will drift plus or minus several points.

May the Plasma be with you.
