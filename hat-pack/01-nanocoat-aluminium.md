## Nanocoat Aluminium foil/sheets

The purpose of this step is to prepare aluminium foil for use in plasma batteries.

### Ingredients
  - Aluminium foil/sheet
  - caustic soda 
  - seawater
  - sulphur powder (optional)
  - large container for the mixing process (glass or plastic)
  - storage container for the solution (glass or plastic)
  - voltmeter
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* Method 1: Hotwater/Caustic
* Method 2: Seawater/Caustic/Sulphur

## Method 1: Hotwater/Caustic
* 15g caustic/7.5 litres water (2g caustic/1 litre water)

Mix caustic and water, place aluminium into liquid and leave for 30-40min

## Method 2: Seawater/Caustic/Sulphur
* 11.6l seawater/500g caustic/100g sulphur (1l seawater/ 43g Caustic/ 9g Sulphur)

Add sulphur then caustic then small amounts of seawater and stir until completly disolved, wait a bit and stir again. Caution the water will heat up. Pour the mix into the ramining seawater and stir.  Allow to settle until you have a good layer of clear yellow liquid on the top.

Once settled draw off the the clear yellow liquid and put into jars ready to nanocoat your aluminium.

Dip the aluminium into the yellow solution briefly and remove.  Allow to sit for a moment and dip again.  When nano-coating foil donot leave in the solution too long as it decays rapidly.

## Summary
Test the aluminium with multimeter set to 200 Ohms - reading should register no resistance (1 or 0L depends on meter type)

May the Plasma be with you.
