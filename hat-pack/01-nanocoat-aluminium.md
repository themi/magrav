## Nanocoat Aluminium foil/sheets

The purpose of this step is to prepare a aluminium foil for use in plasma batteries.

### Ingredients
  - Aluminium foil/sheet
  - caustic soda 
  - seawater
  - sulphur powder
  - large container for the mixing process (glass or plastic)
  - storage container for the solution (glass or plastic)
  - voltmeter
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* Prepare the catalyst soltuion
* Nano-coating

## Prepare the catalyst soltuion

* 2.3l of seawater
* 100grams Caustic Soda
* 20grams Sulphur Powder

Add sulphur and caustic to 300ml of seawater and stir thoroughly. Caution the water will heat up. Pour the mix into the ramining seawater and stir.  Allow to settle until you have a good layer of clear yellow liquid on the top.

Once settled draw off the the clear yellow liquid and put into jars ready to use.

## Nano-coating

Dip the aluminium into the yellow solution briefly and remove.  Allow to sit for a moment and dip again.  When nano-coating foil donot leave in the solution too long as it decays rapidly.

## Summary
Test the aluminium with multimeter set to 200 Ohms resistance - reading should remain at 1  (no resistance)
