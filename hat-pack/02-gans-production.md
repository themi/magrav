## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce GANS.  GANS is needed to coat Mag/Grav coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central power source for completed Mag/Grav coil sets.  

### Ingredients
* Nanocoated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* saltwater (or seawater)
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup and run
Suspend the nanocoated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire so that current can flow between them.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating with-out a current. This proces is gradual and will take up to seven days to accumulate GANS.

Alternatively connect a 1.5V 10-30A current in-bewteen the 2 plates, you will need to pump air into the saline solution otherwise the GANS will not be oxidised enough and thus be of a lower mag/grav strength.

The nancoated copper plate is considered the anode (+ve) and therefore the current's (+ve) terminal should be connected to it.  However reversing the connection will still yeild GANS.  Its the presence of the saline, air, copper and brass that produce the GANS not the direction of current, all the current does is speed up the process (hence the need for air pump).

When using current, GANS production will cease within 24 hours, everything you have created upto this point will contribute directly to how long that time is.  You can reset and re-nanocoat the plates as required.

#### Harvest and Rinsing
Disconnect any wiring and Allow GANS to settle at the bottom of container.  Suck up the GANS with siringe and put into a rinsing container.  Or gently pour off the saltwater into a separate container.

Save the saline/saltwater to use again.

Top up the rinsing container with distilled water, agitate slightly, allow to settle and pour off excess water - this has salt in it so save it with the other saltwater.

Rinse 2 or 3 times and store.  Store the GANS in its colloid form (suspended in water). 

#### Drying

Place GANS colloid in a shallow container and leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  

- For coating coils you need it to be the consistancy of thin paste.

- For the GANS balls you need it to be the consistancy of a thick paste.

- For capacitors you need it to be in powder form.  (or just soak your paper or cloth in GANS and allow that to dry completely)

## Summary

You will need about of 500ml+ of GANS before you start making your power unit, I recommend that you keep producing GANS right up to point where you complete your power unit to ensure you have sufficient. 

May the plasma be with you.
