## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce GANS.  GANS is needed to coat Mag/Grav coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central power source for completed Mag/Grav coil sets.  

### Ingredients
* Nanocoated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* saltwater (or seawater)
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup
* Harvest
* Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup
Suspend the nanocoated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire so that any current can flow between them.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating except with-out any current pushed between them. This proces is gradual and will take up to seven days to accumulate GANS.

Alternatively connect a 1.5V 10-30A current in-bewteen the 2 plates, you will need to pump air into the saline solution otherwise the GANS will not be oxidised and thus be of a lower grade.

#### Harvest
#### Rinsing
#### Drying


#### faster production

* connect a 1.5V source.
  - Connect batteries (+) pole to the brass plate.
  - Connect batteries (-) pole to the nanocoated copper plate.
  - The current from battery is actually a bit on the high side, if you want to be perdantic you could install a resistor on this circut to regulate the current down to 15-30mA

* add air pump
  - oxygen is important in the GANS process, GANS will be bright turquiose in colour when oxygen is present.
  - GANS will be brown in colour when there is insufficent oxygen.
  - when not using a battery the process is quite slow and oxygen is pulled from the air above the water.

* run for 4-7 hours

#### Harvest

* Siringe the GANS 
  - put the siringe tip into the GANS at the bottom of the container and extend the siringe to suck up the material.
  - place into the rinsing container

* let the GaNs settle

* Siringe out the water
  - remove the water from the rinsing container

* Add distilled water
  - now refill the rinsing container with distilled water

* repeat rinsing 2-3 times.

* dry the GANS
  - place GANS into storage container
  - leave lid off  for 2/3 days (place under a heat lamp to make it fry faster)
 
* Store it
  - once GANS is the consitency of running paste, replace lid and store for later use.

#### Go again

Depending on the size of your plates you can rerun again 1 or 2 times.  When the water becomes unusually misty, then reset your setup. 


## Summary

You will need a min of 600ml+ of GANS before you start making your power unit, I recommend that you keep producing GANS right up to point where you complete your power unit to ensure you have sufficient. 

May the plasma be with you.
