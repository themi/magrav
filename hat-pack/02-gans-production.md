## GANS Production

GANS is a new state of matter; a molecule of a gas (GAs) which becomes Nano of itself and appears as Solid state of matter. GAs to Nano of Solid and to be called GANS for short.  

The purpose of this step is to produce GANS.  This is needed to coat magnetic/gravitic coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a plasma power source.  

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper sheet/plate
* Zinc/Copper/Iron sheet/plate (similar size to copper plate)
* distilled/demineralised water
* unprocessed salt
* electrical wire
* glass beaker 
* 20mm test tube
* separation container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Configuration options
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying
* Other GANS


#### 1. Configuration options

GANS | Cathode | Medium | Plates joined by | Cathode submerged | colour
-----|---------|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------
CO2 | Zinc |  Saltwater | LED | No | Off-White 
ZnO | Zinc |  Saltwater | wire| Yes | White
CH3 | Iron |  Saltwater | LED| No | Orange
CuO | Copper | Saltwater | wire| Yes | Teal

In all cases the anode is nanocoated copper. 

#### 2. Setup and run
To make CO2 GANS:

a. Roll up a nan-coated copper sheet and place into a testube.  
b. Fill a beaker with a 5% - 10% saltwater solution.  
c. Wrap the Zinc sheet around the beaker to completely cover the outside.  
d. Place the test tube (with nano-coated copper inside) into the saltwater solution.  
e. Connect the Zinc and nano-coated copper with an LED. (+)ve to the nanocoated copper, (-)ve to the zinc  
f. A white substance will accumulate in the saltwater solution, this may take a few days.  

NOTES:  

* Testube: 20mm OD x 120mm.  Alternative: a plastic bag.  
* Beaker: Tall Form 250mm.  Alternative: coke bottle (cut off the neck).  

#### 3. Harvest and Rinsing

a. Pour the solution incl GANS into a separation container.  
b. Allow GANS to settle at the bottom.  
c. Separate the saltwater from the GANS - save the saltwater for re-use.  
d. Refill with distilled water.  
e. Let GANS settle and separate the water from the GANS.  
f. Repeat step d. and e. 2-3 times.  
g. Store GANS as colloid (in the water) keep in a dark place (little to no sunlight).  

NOTES:  

* Reuse the saltwater solution - it has been coded with the CO2 GANS structure from previous run and making subsequent production quicker.

#### 4. Drying

Only dry the GANS prior to use and to the degree required for its eventual application.

a. Place GANS (colloid) in a shallow container.  
b. Leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  
c. Dry to powder form for making capacitors designed for hybrid plasma/electrical units.  
d. Dry GANS to a paste consistancy for sphere reactors.  
e. leave GANS in colloid coating coils.  

#### 5. Other GANS

##### Seawater (CO2) GANS

a. Mix 1 litre seawater and a tablespoon caustic crystals.  
b. Stir thoroughly and allow to settle.  
c. Separate and rinse as detailed above.  

NOTES: 

* This is mostly CO2 GANS however seawater has many other trace elements and therefore many other GANS type will be present.

#####  Lead (Pb) GANS

a. Same as normal GANS using Leads as the cathode.

NOTES:  

* This is a "sink" GANS which drains plasma.  Ideal for inducing a flow in your power unit, use in a standard plasma capacitor and place in series after your load (may need a diaode after it to prevent back flow from plasma batteries battery).

* CAUTION: The gas released during production of Pb GANS is lethal!  

* CAUTION: Handling pB GANS will drain plasma from you!  Have on you a container of CO2 GANS to mitigate the effect while handling Pb GANS  

## Summary

GANS Strength - Plasma flows from stronger GANS to weaker GANS and that strength is related to its molecular weight.
