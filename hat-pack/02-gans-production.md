## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce CuO2+CO2 GANS.  This is needed to coat magnetic/gravitic coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central plasma power source for assembled mag/grav coil sets.

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* distilled/demineralised water
* unprocessed salt
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup and run
Suspend the nano-coated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire to close the circuit.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating with-out a current. This process is gradual and will take several days to produce all the GANS that can be produced with that setup.

The GANS from copper or brass (Copper/Zinc alloy) will be a blue/green or teal colour. 

##### Applying a current

Introducing a current will decrease production time however the following factors need special attention: 

_Voltage_. I recommend 1.5VDC or less.  Keeping the voltage low makes it easier to control the other factors.

_Current_. I recommend 30mA or less.  The amount of extra resistance to apply to your circut will vary based on the size of your plates, the number of nano-coating layers, the length of your connecting wires and amount of salt water solution, salinity and running time.  Using a Laboratory Power Supply is best.

_Oxygen_. The more current you apply to the setup the more air you need to pump into the saltwater solution.  Without current the ambient air in the solution and on the surface is sufficient to supply the production process, however with current there may not be enough ambient oxygen to oxidise the GANS.  GANS will still be produced but without oxygen, and thus of a lower strength.

#### Harvest and Rinsing
If all is set correctly then the gans colour should be a blue/green or teal colour.  Inspect your nano-coated copper regularily, when the nano-coating has been stripped back to copper the setup is exhausted and needs reseting.    Disconnect any wiring and Allow GANS to settle at the bottom of container.  Suck up the GANS with siringe and put into a rinsing container.  Or gently pour off the saltwater.

Top up the rinsing container with distilled water, agitate slightly, allow to settle and pour off excess water.

Rinse 2 or 3 times and store.  Store the GANS as colloid (suspended in water). 

#### Drying

Place GANS colloid in a shallow container and leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  

- For coating coils you need it to be watery enough so you can pour it over the coils and the excess runs off quite freely.  Then allow coils to dry completely.

- For capacitors you need it to be in powder form or soak your paper/cloth in wet GANS and allow it to dry off completely.

## Seawater (CO2) GANS

Mix 1 litre seawater and about a tablespoon caustic soda, stir thoroughly and leave 2hrs. Thats it! Now rinse and dry as appropriate.

Note: This is mostly CO2 GANS however seawater has many other trace elements and therefore many other GANS type will be present.

## Lead (Pb) GANS

This is a "sink" GANS which drains plasma.  Ideal for inducing a flow in your power unit, use in a standard plasma capaictor and place in series after your load (may need a diaode after it to prevent back flow from plasma batteries battery).

> CAUTION: The gas released during production of Pb GANS is lethal!  
> CAUTION: Handling pB GANS will drain plasma from you!  Have on you a container of CO2 GANS to nullify the effect while handling Pb GANS  

## Plasma flows from stronger to weaker
GANS strength is related to its molecular weight:

Cathode |  | Molar Mass
----------|----|--------
Plutonium | Pu | 238.049 
Uranium   | U  | 238.029 
Lead      | Pb | 207.200 
Mercury   | Hg | 205.590 
Gold      | Au | 196.967 
Tin       | Sn | 118.710 
Silver    | Ag | 107.868 
Zinc      | Zn |  65.380 
Nikle     | Ni |  58.693 
Iron      | Fe |  55.845 
Copper    | Cu |  53.546 
Titanium  | Ti |  47.867 
Aluminium | Al |  26.982 
Oxigen    | O  |  15.999 
Carbon    | C  |  12.010 
Hydrogen  | H  |   1.008 

## Summary

The GANS required for a hybrid plasma/electrical unit:

* CH3 GANS (strength: 18)
  - both anode (nanocoated copper) and cathode (iron) isolated from the medium (saltwater) and ambient current is drained (connected with a LED or pc fan). Distance between anode and cathode is apporox 20mm.

* CO2 GANS (strength: 44)
  - both anode (nanocoated copper) and cathode (zinc) isolated from the medium (saltwater) and ambient current is drained (connected with a LED or pc fan). Distance between anode and cathode is approx 20mm.

* CuO GANS (strength: 70)
  - anode (nanocoated copper) is isolated from the medium (saltwater), cathode (copper) submerged in medium, connect with current (1.5v or less, 30mA or less). Distance between anode and cathode is approx 20mm.

* PbO GANS (strength: 222)
  - anode (nanocoated copper) is isolated from the medium (saltwater), cathode (lead) submerged in medium, connect with current (1.5v or less, 30mA or less). Distance between anode and cathode is approx 20mm.

May the plasma be with you.
