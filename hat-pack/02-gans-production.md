## GANS Production

GANS is a new state of matter; a molecule of a gas (GAs) which becomes Nano of itself and appears as Solid state of matter. GAs to Nano of Solid and to be called GANS for short.  

The purpose of this step is to produce GANS.  This is needed to coat magnetic/gravitic coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a plasma power source.  

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* distilled/demineralised water
* unprocessed salt
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Configuration options
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying
* Other GANS


#### 1. Configuration options

GANS | Cathode | Medium | Plates joined by | Plate submerged | colour
-----|---------|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------
CO2 | Zinc |  Saltwater | LED | No | Off-White 
ZnO | Zinc |  Saltwater | wire| Yes | White
CH3 | Iron |  Saltwater | LED| No | Orange
CuO | Copper | Saltwater | wire| Yes | Teal

In all cases the anode is nanocoated copper. 

#### 2. Setup and run
To make CO2 GANS:

a. Roll up a Zinc sheet and place into a testube.  
b. Fill a beaker with a 5% - 10% saltwater solution.  
c. Wrap the nancoated copper plate around the beaker to completely cover the outside.  
d. Place the test tube (with Zinc inside) into the saltwater solution.  
e. Connect the Zinc and copper with an LED.  (+)ve to the nanocoated copper, (-)ve to the zinc.  
f. After several days a white substance will accumulate in the saltwater solution.  

NOTES:  

* Testube: 20mm OD x 120mm.  Alternative: a plastic bag.  
* Beaker: Tall Form 250mm.  Alternative: coke bottle (cut off the neck).  


#### 3. Harvest and Rinsing

a. Remove the anode and cathode.  
b. Allow GANS to settle at the bottom.  
c. Pour off the saltwater (dont throw away, top-up and reuse).  
d. Refill with distilled water.  
e. Pour off the water.  
f. Repeat step d. and e. 2-3 times.  
g. Store GANS (in water) keep in a dark place (no sunlight).  

NOTES:  

* Reuse the saltwater solution - it has been coded with the CO2 GANS structure from previous run and making subsequent production will be easier.

#### 4. Drying

Only dry the GANS prior to use and to the degree required for its eventual application.

a. Place GANS (colloid) in a shallow container.  
b. Leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  
c. Dry to powder form for making capacitors designed for hybrid plasma/electrical units.  
d. Dry GANS to a paste consistancy for sphere reactors.  
e. Dry GANS to a watery consistancy for coil coating.  

#### 5. Other GANS

##### Seawater (CO2) GANS

a. Mix 1 litre seawater and a tablespoon caustic crystals.  
b. Stir thoroughly and allow to settle.  
c. Continue from the rinsing step.  

NOTES: 

* This is mostly CO2 GANS however seawater has many other trace elements and therefore many other GANS type will be present.

#####  Lead (Pb) GANS

a. Same as normal GANS using Leads as the cathode.

NOTES:  

* This is a "sink" GANS which drains plasma.  Ideal for inducing a flow in your power unit, use in a standard plasma capacitor and place in series after your load (may need a diaode after it to prevent back flow from plasma batteries battery).

* CAUTION: The gas released during production of Pb GANS is lethal!  

* CAUTION: Handling pB GANS will drain plasma from you!  Have on you a container of CO2 GANS to nullify the effect while handling Pb GANS  

## Summary

GANS Strength - Plasma flows from stronger GANS to weaker GANS and that strength is related to its molecular weight.
