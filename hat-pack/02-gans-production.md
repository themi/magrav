## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce CuO2+CO2 GANS.  This is needed to coat magnetic/gravitic coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central plasma power source for assembled mag/grav coil sets.

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* distilled/demineralised water
* unprocessed salt
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup and run
Suspend the nano-coated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire to close the circuit.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating with-out a current. This process is gradual and will take several days to produce all the GANS that can be produced with that setup.

The GANS from copper or brass (Copper/Zinc alloy) will be a blue/green or teal colour. 

##### Applying a current

Introducing a current will decrease production time however the following factors need special attention: 

_Voltage_. I recommend 1.2 to 1.5VDC.  Keeping the voltage low makes it easier to control the other factors and I have found that 1.5VDC works well.

_Current_. I recommend 30-50mA.  The amount of extra resistance to apply to your circutt will vary based on the size of your plates, the number of nano-coating layers, the length of your connecting wires and amount of salt water solution, salinity and running time.  Using a variable resistor or better still a Laboratory Power Supply is required.

_Oxygen_. The more current you apply to the setup the more air you need to pump into the saltwater solution.  Without current the ambient air in the solution and on the surface is sufficient to supply the production process, however with current there will not be enough ambient oxygen to oxidise the GANS.  GANS will still be produced but without oxygen, and thus of a lower strength.

_Cathode/Anode_. The nano-coated copper plate is the cathode (-ve) so connect the current's negative terminal to the nano-coated plate.   Note: Reversing the connection will still yeild GANS - its the presence of salt, oxygen, nano-coating and the anode that produce the GANS not the direction of current.

#### Harvest and Rinsing
If all is set correctly then the gans colour should be a blue/green or teal colour.  Inspect your nano-coated copper regularily, when the nano-coating has been stripped back to copper the setup is exhausted and needs reseting.    Disconnect any wiring and Allow GANS to settle at the bottom of container.  Suck up the GANS with siringe and put into a rinsing container.  Or gently pour off the saltwater.

Top up the rinsing container with distilled water, agitate slightly, allow to settle and pour off excess water.

Rinse 2 or 3 times and store.  Store the GANS as colloid (suspended in water). 

#### Drying

Place GANS colloid in a shallow container and leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  

- For coating coils you need it to be watery enough so you can pour it over the coils and the excess runs off quite freely.  Then allow coils to dry completely.

- For capacitors you need it to be in powder form or soak your paper/cloth in wet GANS and allow it to dry off completely.

- If you are connecting your power unit to the mains the entire capacitor and the coils must be 'bone' dry to avoid shorting.

## Seawater (CO2) GANS

Mix 1 litre seawater and about a tablespoon caustic soda, stir thoroughly and leave 2hrs. Thats it! Now rinse and dry as appropriate.

Note: This is mostly CO2 GANS however seawater has many other trace elements and therefore other GANS type may be present.


## Summary

You will need about 100-200ml of GANS to complete your power unit. 

Here are some examples of GANS you can try - You are encouraged to try different combinations, nano-coat the anode, use other materials, use multiple anodes (of different materials) and expand this table.

The GANS colour will be the colour of the rust of the anode metal. 

GANS | Cathode | Anode | Colour | !
----- | ------- | ------ | ----- | ---
 | nc copper | titanium (Ti) | Pink | Pink
CuO2 | nc copper | copper (Cu) | Black | Blue/Green
CO2 | nc copper | zinc (Zn) | White | White
 | nc copper | iron Oxide (Fe3O4) | Yellow | Red/Orange/Brown
 | nc copper | silver (Ag) | Yellow | Red->Blue->Black
 | nc copper | brass (Cu+Zn) | |
 | nc copper | shibuichi (Cu+Ag) | |

> nc = nano-coated
> Colour = The colour of the first signs of rust (tarnish) of the metal
> ! = The colour of fully developed rust of the metal

GANS strength is related to its atomic weight, for example: C02 GANS has less strength than CuO2 GANS. On a 3 tier coil power unit - the GANS strength should decrease for each ascending coil.  Plasma naturally flows from the higher strength to lower strength and this is a key datum to creating perpetual flow.  

May the plasma be with you.
