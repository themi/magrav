## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce CuO2/CO2 GANS mix.  GANS is needed to coat mag/grav coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central power source for assembled mag/grav coil sets.  

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* saltwater (or seawater)
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup and run
Suspend the nano-coated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire to close the circuit.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating with-out a current. This process is gradual and will take up to 7/14 days to produce all the GANS that it can be produced.

The GANS from a brass (Copper/Zinc alloy) plate will be a turqiose colour.  Note If its muddy brown then try pumping air into the saline solution (the next time).

__Alternatively__ connect a 1.5V 10-30A current in-bewteen the 2 plates, you may need to pump air into the saline solution otherwise the GANS will not be oxidised enough.

The nano-coated copper plate is the cathode (-ve) however reversing the connection will still yeild GANS.  Its the presence of the salt, air, copper and brass that produce the GANS not the direction of current, the presence of current makes production quicker however the disadvantage is that you need to pump air into the saline mix to keep up with the increased rate of GANS production.

When using the alternative methods, GANS production will cease a lot sooner than 7/14 days.  The time depends on the amount of current you use, size of plates, amount of liquid.

#### Harvest and Rinsing
When the colour of GANS being produced starts to change, its time to stop production.  Disconnect any wiring and Allow GANS to settle at the bottom of container.  Suck up the GANS with siringe and put into a rinsing container.  Or gently pour off the saltwater into a separate container.

Top up the rinsing container with distilled water, agitate slightly, allow to settle and pour off excess water.

Rinse 2 or 3 times and store.  Store the GANS as colloid (suspended in water). 

#### Drying

Place GANS colloid in a shallow container and leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  

- For coating coils you need it to be watery enough so you can pour it over the coils and the excess runs off quite freely.  Then allow coils to dry completely.

- For the GANS (centre) balls you need it to be the consistancy of paste.

- For capacitors you need it to be in powder form or soak your paper/cloth in wet GANS and allow it to dry off completely.

- If you are connecting your power unit to the mains the entire capacitor and the coils must be 'bone' dry to avoid shorting.

## Summary

To reset plates: soak in white vinegar for 2-3 hours, rinse off with tap water and scrub plate with wire wool or fine grit sandpaper, then nano-coat the copper again. 

You will need about of 100/200ml of GANS to complete your power unit. 

Here are some examples of GANS you can try - You are encouraged to try different combinations, nano-coat the anode, use other materials, use multiple anodes (of different materials) and expand this table.

GANS | Cathode | Anode | Colour
----- | ------- | ------ | -----
CO2 | nc copper plate | bare zinc | White
??O2 | nc copper plate | bare silver |    (??? Amber/Bronze)
CHO2 | nc copper plate | bare iron | Dark Red
CuO2 | nc copper plate | bare copper | Blue Green
CuO2+CO2 | nc copper plate | bare brass | Turquoise/Teal

> nc = nano-coated

May the plasma be with you.
