## GANS harvesting

The purpose of this step is to produce CuO2/CO2 GANS mix.  GANS is needed to coat mag/grav coils, construct capacitor coils, and serve as a central power source for assembled mag/grav coil sets.  

This instruction defines the anode as the nano-coated copper and the cathode is a brass plate - you can substitude the cathode for another material to make another kind of GANS.

### Ingredients
* Nano-coated coppper plate
* Brass plate (similar size to copper plate)
* saltwater (or seawater)
* Electrical wire
* 1.5v battery
* air pump (fish tank air pump)
* container for the process  
* 50/60ml siringe (or turkey baster)
* rinsing container
* storage container

### Procedure
* Setup and run
* Harvest and Rinsing
* Drying

#### Setup and run
Suspend the nano-coated copper and brass plates in a saline mix (15%-20%). Join each plate together with a electrical wire to close the circuit.  Setup in the same way you would electrolysis or electroplating with-out a current. This process is gradual and will take up to 7/14 days to produce all the GANS that it can be produced.

The GANS from a brass (Copper/Zinc alloy) plate will be a very bright turqiose colour.  Note If its Brown/Orange then it was starved of oxygen during production.

__Alternatively__ connect a 1.5V 10-30A current in-bewteen the 2 plates, you will need to pump air into the saline solution otherwise the GANS will not be oxidised enough and thus be of a lower mag/grav strength.  With a 1.5V battery you may need to add more resistence/resistors to get current down to 10-30mA.

The nano-coated copper plate is the anode (+ve) and using the electrolysis handbook the battery's (+ve) terminal should be connected to it.  However reversing the connection will still yeild GANS.  Its the presence of the saline, air, copper and brass that produce the GANS not the direction of current, current makes it flow faster (hence the need for air pump).

__Alternately__ connect a resistive object in between the plates (with no current).  Example - computer fan or LED light.  There wont be enough current to make the object work but this method works the same way as above and it encourages the GANS production to occur.

When using current or resistive methods, GANS production will be exhausted within 24/48 hours as opposed to 7/14 days.

#### Harvest and Rinsing
Disconnect any wiring and Allow GANS to settle at the bottom of container.  Suck up the GANS with siringe and put into a rinsing container.  Or gently pour off the saltwater into a separate container.

Save the saline/saltwater to use again.

Top up the rinsing container with distilled water, agitate slightly, allow to settle and pour off excess water - this has a little salt in it so save it with the other saline/saltwater.

Rinse 2 or 3 times and store.  Store the GANS in its colloid form (suspended in water). 

#### Drying

Place GANS colloid in a shallow container and leave in the open air or put under a heat lamp.  

- For coating coils you need it to be the consistancy of watery paste.

- For the GANS balls you need it to be the consistancy of a thick paste.

- For capacitors you need it to be in powder form.  (or just soak your paper/cloth in GANS and allow it to dry)

## Summary

You will need about of 100/200ml of GANS to complete your power unit. 

Here are some examples of GANS you can try - You are encouraged to try different combinations, use multiple cathodes, use other materials and expand this table.

GANS | Anode | Cathode | Colour
----- | ------------- | ------------- | -----
CuO2 | Nano-coated copper plate | bare copper | Dark Turquoise
CO2 | Nano-coated copper plate | bare zinc | White
CuO2/CO2 | Nano-coated copper plate | bare brass | Bright Turquoise
CH3O2 | Nano-coated copper plate | bare iron | Dark Red
AgO2 | Nano-coated copper plate | bare silver | Grey


May the plasma be with you.
