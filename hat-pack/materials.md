## Tools

#### Mandrel/Rod
#### Drill bit (metal)
#### Electric Hand Drill
#### Wire cutters

#### Protective clothing
- Disposable latex gloves for handling nano coated materials.  You must avoid getting body oils onto the nano coating.
- Rubber gloves and eye protectors for handling caustic. Caustic reacts violently with heated water, extreme caution must be taken.
- Leather gloves for making coiled wire. Optional protection.

#### Volt Meter
- For bleeding charge while nano coating. A $20 meter will work just great.

#### Temperature sensitive circuit breaker
* for use in a Magrav unit
  - To prevent user from overloading unit. This is a safety precaution, if you dont install this on your unit, then before using it, you must understand the full theory of the unit and the magrav/plasma tech its built on.
  - Vacuum cleaner's generally have this unit installed in it.

#### Plastic/Glass containers
  - 20l Stainless Steel pot and single outdoor heating element
  - 6l for GANS harvesting (Reject Shop)

#### Wire mesh
- Enough to cover the bottom of the castic bath container to keep copper away from the floor and caustic crystals 

#### Plastic clips
- Curtain hangers for example - to attach to plates and hang them saline solution.

#### Cross Spacers
- separators for quads of Magrav capacitors / batteries

#### Electrical wire
- Insulated copper wire of any description to close the circut between materials while GANS harvesting.

#### Aligator clips

#### AA/D size batteries
* power oxygem pump
* induce the transfer for harvesting GANS 

#### Fish tank pump and hose
* Auburn Aquarium Pet Centr 
  - 115-117 Parramatta Road, Auburn, NSW 2144
  - Opposite Nike Factory & Lonsdale Shop

#### Rubber gloves/Eye protection
For handling caustic bath

#### Disposable Latex Gloves (XL)
For handling nanocoted materials

#### Glass/Plastic pots
For GANS storage






## Custom units
#### GANS Capacitor
- To close (and influence) the circut between materials while GANS harvesting.

#### Insulated GANS capacitor
* for use in a Magrav unit
* The difference being:
  - Dry GANS
  - Heat resitent paper to wrap the dry GANS. eg. Baking paper
  - Heat shrink tubes, Rubber Liquid or Electrical tape to insulate the entire unit

#### GANS Battery

#### Magrav Power unit

#### Magrav reactor
