## Power unit

The purpose of this step is to construct/assemble a plasma power unit. 

### Ingredients
* GANS balls
* 3 x Coils sets
* 4 x Plasma Capactors
* Qty of nano-coated connection wires 
* Thermal Circuit Breaker
* Power-board

### Process
* Circuit diagram


#### Circuit diagram

Some assembly required

##### Main circuit
* Grid Power (+ve) to Circuit breaker in.
* Circuit breaker out to Power Unit (-ve) magnetic 
* Power Unit (+ve) gravitic to Load (+ve)
* Load (-ve) to Grid Power (-ve)
* Load (earth) to Grid Power (earth)

##### Capacitor circuit 

> In parallel after Circuit Breaker and before Power Unit 

* Capacitor 1-4 (-ve) to Power (+ve)
* Capacitor 1-4 (+ve) to Load (-ve)
