## Nanocoat copper plates

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  Copper is used because of its unique qualities and an economical way to get up and running, later you can experiment with other materials.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - caustic soda crystals
  - boiling (distilled) water
  - steam bath container (plastic, glass or ceramic) with lid
  - mesh/tray (chiken wire galvanised or stainless steel)
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - voltmeter
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4-6mm bit
  - side cutters and needle nose pliers
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* De-oxidise
* Hot caustic bath
* Caustic steaming
* Drying

#### De-oxidise
New plates generally don't need this step.  Place in white vinegar (cold) bath for 6-8 hours.  Thoroughly rinse off vinegar with cold water.  I scrubed them with wire wool to make it look shinny but not really necessary.

#### Hot caustic bath
This step removes any organic material and prepares the copper for nano-coating.  Simply place copper into a boiling bath (40-50C) of caustic soda for 20-30 minutes, or ...

Place enough dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container to completely cover the bottom of it.  Put a stainless steel mesh over it so the copper doesnt touch the caustic crystals then place copper onto mesh. Pour enough boiling water into the container so the copper is completely submersed and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  
CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Then leave to cool down (2-3 hours).
Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.  You may need to clean/filter the liquid first as this process also removes organic material from the copper which manifests as a dark oily residue.

Note: 
> To minimise handling of plates after they are nano-coated, prepare/shape the copper plate for the GANS production phase. Prepare it so it can be suspended in liquid as you would an eletrolysis anode/cathode.

#### Caustic Steaming
This step nanocoats the copper, by suspending the copper in the steam of the caustic (NaOH).

Place some dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, lightly covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mesh over it so the copper is kept out of the caustic liquid (once water is poured in) then place copper onto mesh or suspend from sides of container.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover the caustic crystals and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner, then allow to sit for 48-72 hours.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.

Every 6 hours touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m or 2m DCV).  The reason for this step is to put a small charge across the copper so that the newly attached nano-coating aligns in the same direction. Apply the red/black electrodes in the same way each time.  I put the red electrode to the top or point where a wire will connect and the black electrode to the bottom or place on the mesh if the plates are touching the wire mesh.  Note: for coils, the black electrode to magnetic post and red electrode to gravitic post.

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.

You may nano-coat (caustic steamimg) as many times as you like.  If the copper is for harvesting GANS then the more layers the better.

Note: 
> After the plate has been nanocoated avoid handling with bare hands or ruin coating with tools.  

#### Drying
This step dries the nano-coated copper plates and seals the nano-coating.  This should be done very slowly, over a period of 48-72 hours. 

Place a small amount of cold caustic liquid in the bottom of your container and suspend the copper in the container (not touching the liquid) with the lid slightly open.

Every 6 hours continue to touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m DCV) to align the nanolayers.

## Summary
The nano-coated copper will have a deep black/bluish colour.  There may be salt (Na) deposits on the plate which came from the caustic soda (NaOH), before use: rinse this off with distilled water and then air dry.

GANS production require several largley spaced nano-partilces and the caustic method facilitates this process.  The nano-particles detach from the copper and causes the production of GANS.

May the Plasma be with you.
