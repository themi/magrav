## Nanocoat copper plates

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  Copper is used because of its unique qualities and an economical way to get up and running, later you can experiment with other materials.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - caustic soda crystals
  - boiling (distilled) water
  - steam bath container (plastic, glass or ceramic) with lid
  - mesh/tray
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - voltmeter
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4mm bit
  - side cutters
  - needle nose pliers
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* Hot caustic bath
* Caustic steaming
* Drying

#### Hot caustic bath
This step cleans and prepares the copper for nano-coating.  Simply place copper into a boiling bath (40-50C) of caustic soda for 20-30 minutes.

Alternatively place a generous quantity dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, completely covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mesh over it so the copper doesnt touch the caustic crystals then place copper onto mesh. Pour in enough boiling water into the container so the copper is submersed and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Then leave to cool down (2-3 hours).

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.  You may need to clean/filter the liquid first as its purpose is to remove organic material from the copper which manifests as a dark oily residue.

Note: 
> Prepare/shape the copper plate for the GANS production phase before nanocoating - prepare it so it can be suspended in liquid as you would an eletrolysis anode or cathode.

#### Caustic Steaming
This step nanocoats the copper, by suspending the copper in the fumes/gas of the caustic (NaOH).

Place a some dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mesh over it so the copper is kept out of the caustic liquid (once water is poured in) then place copper onto mesh or suspend from sides of container.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover the caustic crystals and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner, then allow to sit for 48-72 hours.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.

Every 6 hours touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m DCV).  The reason for this step is to put a small charge across the copper so that the newly attached nanocoating aligns in the same direction. It is important to apply the red/black electrodes in the same way each time.  For coils: black electrode to magnetic post and red electrode to gravitic post.

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.

You may nanocoat (caustic steamimg) as many times as you like.  If the copper is for harvesting GANS then the more layers the better.

Note: 
> After the plate has been nanocoated you should NOT handle copper with bare hands or ruin coating with tools.  

#### Drying
This step dries the nano-coated copper plates and seals the nano-coating.  This should be done very slowly, over a period of 48 hours. 

Place a a small amount of cold caustic liquid in the bottom of your container and suspend the copper in the container (not touching the liquid) with the lid slightly open.

Every 6 hours touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m DCV).  Nanolayering is still occurring so keep this step in.

Note: 
> You can reset caustic nanocoating on copper by heating (gas burner for example) it until it just about turns red hot, then quickly dip in cold water.  The Nanocoating will drop off into the cold water.  You can restart the nanocoating process from the beginning.  DONT THROW away the nanocoating that falls off, keep it for future use.

## Summary
The nano-coated copper will have a deep black colour over.  There will be salt (Na) deposits on the plate which came from the caustic soda (NaOH), before use: rinse this off with distilled water and then air dry.

GANS production require several largley spaced nano-partilces and the caustic method facilitates this process.  The nano-particles detach from the copper and causes the production of GANS.

May the Plasma be with you.
