## Nanocoat copper plates

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  Copper is used because of its unique properties and an economical way to get up and running.  Other metals can be used though the nanocaoting process will differ.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - caustic soda 
  - boiling water
  - steam bath 6ltr container (plastic, glass or ceramic) with lid
  - mesh/tray (chiken wire galvanised or stainless steel)
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - voltmeter
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4-6mm bit
  - side cutters and needle nose pliers
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* De-oxidise
* Hot caustic bath
* Caustic steaming
* Drying

#### De-oxidise
Place in a bath of cleaning vinegar overnight or as long as needed to get to bare copper. Thoroughly rinse off with water. Optionally scrub the copper with wire wool, any discolouration will easily come off and be bright and shiny. 

#### Hot caustic bath
This step removes any organic material and prepares the copper surface for nano-coating.  Reheat caustic liquid (40-50C) and place copper into a bath and leave until it cools (2-3 hours) or ...

Place enough dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (or glass) container to thoroughly cover the bottom of it.  Put a stainless steel mesh (or durable plastic) over it so the copper doesnt touch the caustic crystals then place copper onto mesh. Pour enough boiling water into the container so the copper is completely submersed and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  
CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Then leave to cool down (2-3 hours).
Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.  

Note: 
> To minimise handling of plates after they are nano-coated, prepare/shape the copper plate for the GANS production phase. Prepare it so it can be suspended in liquid as you would an eletrolysis anode/cathode.

#### Caustic Steaming
Place copper in a sealable container a cm or two from the bottom. Reheat a small amount of caustic liquid (40-50C) and pour into the container and sealing the container. The positioning of the copper should be above the liquid and not too close to the lid. The hot caustic fumes will cause nanocaoting to occur, allow to sit for at least 24 hours. Note that if the caustic steam cools too quickly the nanocaoting process will be interupted.

Place some dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, lightly covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mesh (or durable plastic) over it so the copper is kept out of caustic liquid (once water is poured in) then place copper onto mesh (or suspend from sides of container).  Pour in enough boiling water to cover the caustic crystals and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Allow to sit for 24 hours.

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.

You may caustic steam as many times as you like.  

Note: 
> After the plate has been nano-coated avoid handling with bare hands or ruin coating with tools.  

#### Drying
This step dries and aligns the nano-coating. This should be done over a period of 48-72 hours. 

Place a small amount of cold caustic liquid in the bottom of your container and suspend the copper in the container (not touching the liquid) with the lid slightly open.

Every 6 hours tap the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m or 2m DCV).  The reason for this step is to put a small charge across the copper so that the newly attached nano-coating re-aligns thus developing a more comprehensive nano structure. 

Place the multi-meter's red electrode on the top left edge of the copper plate and then tap the other electrode on the diagonally opposite edge two-three times. 

## Summary
The nano-coated copper will have a deep black colour.  There may be salt (Na) deposits on the plate which came from the caustic soda (NaOH).

May the Plasma be with you.
