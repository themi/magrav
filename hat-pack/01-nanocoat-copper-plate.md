## Nanocoat copper plates

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  We using  copper because of its unique qualities and an economical way to get up and running, later you can experiment with other materials.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4mm bit
  - side cutters
  - needle nose pliers
  - caustic soda crystals
  - boiling (distilled) water
  - steam bath container with lid
  - mesh/tray
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - spray bottle with fine spary nozzle
  - voltmeter


### Procedure

* Prep copper plate for use in the GANS production phase - using drill or tin snips:
  - craft the copper plate so that it can be suspended slightly away from the side of your GANS harvesting container, and
  - so that the part remaining above the saltwater can be a easily connected by wire or alligator clip. 

Note: 
> After the plate has been nanocoated you should not handle plate with bare hands or ruin coating with tools.  
> Body oil has your Mag/Grav signature in it, allowing your body oil to get on nanocoating or GANS with yield unpredictable results.  
> Completely prepare the copper plate for the GANS production phase before continuing.  

* Place mesh/tray into the steam bath container.
  - mesh may need to be shaped (using wire cutters and/or needle nose pliers) so it fits in the container and keeps the plates 2cm or more, above the level of the boiling caustic water.

* Put on your protective clothing

* Add caustic crystals.
  - completely cover the bottom of the container, be generous.

* Place copper plate onto the mesh/tray

* Partially replace the lid

* Add boiling distilled water
  - pour the boiling water in the slit of the partially open lid
  - CAUTION violent reaction will occur
  - cover the crystals completely but donot fill above the mesh/tray

* Secure the lid 
  - wait until liquid has completely cooled this will take a 2-5 hours.

* Remove the mesh/tray (with copper plate on it)
  - Caution when opening lid, the gases are toxic. 
  - Careful with tray so as not touch or ruin the copper plate

* Pour the cooled caustic liquid into a storage bottle/container for later use.


#### Steaming
* Add caustic
  - this time just barely cover the bottom.

* Replace mesh/tray and copper plate.
  - rotate the copper plate so the other side gets direct caustic exposure 

* Partially replace the lid

* Add boiling distilled water
  - cover the crystals completely this time using a little less water than last time.

* Secure the lid and wait until liquid has completely cooled. 

* repeat steaming at least one more time (more if you think its needs it)
  - if there are any areas where nanacoating (black layering) is not yet taken hold or you have scrapped some off, then fine spray that area with the used caustic you saved from previous steps, and continue steaming. 


#### Drying
* Remove mesh/tray and copper plate 

* Pour out most of the liquid into your castic storage bottle/container
  - leave a small amount of liquid in the container, the drying process should be done gradually

* Replace mesh/tray and copper plate

* replace lid but leave slightly open so evapouration can occur.

* Wait for 6 hours

* Bleed charge off the plate
  - use a volt meter set to 200m DCV with one probe on the plate and one on a connecting mesh or tray
  - maintain for about 10 sec, change postion occaisionally
  - the meter will sway a lot, going up and down the scale
  - donot touch plate with bare hands

* Replace the lid leaving slightly open and wait another 6 hrs

* repeat bleeding process
  - continue this step for at least 2 days, preferably 3 days

* All done
  - plate will have a deep black colour all over and be quite dry
  - there may be patches of not so deep black colour
  - wearing latex gloves, then handling the plate, the nano coating will be firmly attached to the plate and not rub off.


## Summary

You can prepare several plates or just just keep repeating this process as and when more are needed.

The end goal is to make your first Power Unit.  Once it is up and running you will nolonger need to nanocoat with caustic soda, you can use your power unit to nanacoat coppper or other materials.

May the Plasma be with you!
