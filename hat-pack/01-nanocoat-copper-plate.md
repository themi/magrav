## Nanocoat copper plates

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  We using  copper because of its unique qualities and an economical way to get up and running, later you can experiment with other materials.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4mm bit
  - side cutters
  - needle nose pliers
  - caustic soda crystals
  - boiling (distilled) water
  - steam bath container (plastic, glass or ceramic) with lid
  - mesh/tray
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - spray bottle with fine spary nozzle
  - voltmeter


### Procedure
* Hot caustic bath
* Caustic steam bath
* Drying

#### Hot caustic bath
This step prepares the copper for nanocaoting.  Simply place copper into a boiling bath of caustic soda for 3-4 hours.

Alternatively place a generous quantity dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, completely covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mess over it so the copper doesnt touch the caustic crystals then place copper onto mesh. Pour in enough boiling water into the container so the copper is submersed and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Then leave to cool down (24 hours)

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.

Note: 
> After the plate has been nanocoated you should not handle plate with bare hands or ruin coating with tools.  
> Body oil has your personal Mag/Grav signature in it, allowing your body oil to get on nanocoating or GANS with yield unpredictable results.
> Completely prepare the copper plate for the GANS production phase before continuing - prepare it so it can be suspended in liquid as you an eletrolysis anode or cathode.

#### Steaming
This step nanocoats the copper by suspending the copper in the fumes of caustic liquid for 24 hours.

Alternatively place a small quantity dry caustic soda crystals into a plastic (ceramic or glass) container, covering the bottom.  Put a stainless steel mess over it so the copper is kept out of the caustic liquid (once water is poured in) then place copper onto mesh or suspend from sides of container.  Pour in enough boiling water to cover the caustic crystals and quickly replace the lid of the contatiner.  CAUTION hot water reacts violently with caustic.  Then leave for 24 hours.

Every 6 hours touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m DCV).  The reason for this step is to put a small charge across the copper so that the nanocoating all aligns in the same direction therefore apply the red/black electrodes in the same way each time.  For coils: black electrode to magnetic terminal and red electrode to gravetic terminal.

Don't throw away the liquid caustic, store it for later use.

You may nancoat as many times as you like.  If the copper is for harvesting GANS then the more layers the better.


#### Drying
This step is simply to dry the copper of any caustic liquid.  This should be done very slowly, over a period of 24-36 hours. 

Place a a small amount of cool caustic liquid in the bottom of your container and suspend the cooper oin the container with the lid slightly open.

Every 6 hours touch the copper with voltmeter electrodes (set to 200m DCV).  Nanolayering is still occurring so keep this step in.

## Summary

You can prepare several plates or just just keep repeating this process as and when more are needed.

The end goal is to make your first Power Unit.  Once it is up and running you will nolonger need to nanocoat with caustic soda, you can use your power unit to nanacoat the coppper (or other materials).

The copper will have a deep black/blue colour all over.  There will be salt (Na) deposits on the plate which came from the caustic soda (NaOH), rinse this off with warm distilled water and air dry prior to using.

May the Plasma be with you.
