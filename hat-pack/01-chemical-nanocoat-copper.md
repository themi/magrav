## Copper Plates - Chemical Nanocoating 

The purpose of this step is to prepare a copper plate for the GANS harvesting process.  Copper is used because of its unique properties and an economical way to get up and running.  Other metals can be used though the nanocaoting process will differ somewhat.

### Ingredients
  - copper plate 150x75x0.5mm
  - caustic soda or lyre (Sodium hydroxide)
  - boiling water
  - steam bath container (plastic, glass or ceramic) with lid
  - storage bottle for used caustic liquid
  - voltmeter
  - tin snips or electric hand drill with 4-6mm bit
  - side cutters and needle nose pliers
  - protective clothing, rubber gloves and eye protection

### Procedure
* Form the copper as needed
* De-oxidise
* Hot caustic bath
* Caustic steaming
* Drying

#### 1. Form the copper
Do this now before nanocoating because using tools on the copper after nanocoating will simply  destroy that coating.

a. Cut and shape copper plates to size, drill holes for hanging and for connecting wires as required.

#### 2. De-oxidise
This step removes any tarnish from the copper's surface.  

a. Place in a bath of white/cleaning vinegar for as long as needed to get to bare copper.  1-2 hrs for clean copper and 6-12 for badly tarnised copper. 

b. Thoroughly rinse off with water. Optionally scrub the copper with wire wool, any discolouration will easily come off and be bright and shiny.  

#### 3. Hot caustic bath
This step removes any organic material from the copper's surface as a the preparation for nanocoating.  

a. Use enough caustic crystals to _generously_ cover the bottom of your container.  

b. Pour in boiling water and once all crystalls have disolved...  

c. Completely submerge the copper in the liquid and leave until liquid cools.  

CAUTION: Caustic reacts violently with hot water!  

NOTES:  

* You can use glass for your bath container or firm/hard plastic containers.  The caustic won't melt the plastic but the hot water might!

* The ratio of caustic crystals to water is roughly 1:4.


#### Caustic Steaming
This step develops layers of copper/carbon atoms to form on the surface. 

a. Use enough caustic crystals to _barely_ cover the bottom of your container.  

b. Remove copper from caustic bath (from prev stage) and shake of as much liquid as possible.

c. Suspend copper inside the steam container or put on a tray so the copper will be above the top of the liquid. 

c. Pour in boiling water and replace the lid. Leave for 12 hrs.

CAUTION: Caustic reacts violently with hot water!  

NOTES:  

* The ratio of caustic crystals to water is roughly 1:4.

* Keep the steaming container in a warm environment - if the caustic steam cools too quickly then coating will be uneven.


#### Drying
This step grows and strengthens the nanocoat layer/s.  

a. Using the voltmeter set to 200mV DC, place one electrode on the top-left corner of the the plate, and with the other electrode touch the bottom-right corner of the plate, holding for approx 10 sec.

b. Replace lid leaving the it slightly ajar. The humidity in the container should be allowed to _slowly_ drop (get dryer).  

c. Repeat the volmeter step every 6 hrs.

d. Continue this process over the next 48 hrs.  Gradualy reduce the amount of liquid in the container over this period so that after 48hrs there is almost no liquid left.

e. Finally place the copper in a dry environment and leave for 24 hrs.


NOTES:  

* Touching the copper with the electrode passes a small electrical charge across the copper encouraging the nano layers to form a more complex structure.

* The copper should become a deep black colour and once fully dry will have a shiny polished surface and should not flake when gently rubbed.  

* Salt will also crystalise on the surface, this is the sodium in the caustic, no need to clean it off.


## Summary
The surface of the copper now has superconductive properties and is now ready for GANS production.


May the Plasma be with you.
