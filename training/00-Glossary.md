#### Magrav
> (TM) Kesh Foudation and is coined from the words Magnetic and Gravitional.  These are the two primary fields than bind electrons, protons and netrons.  It is also the same fields that binds suns and planets.  It also binds galaxies and universes.  The word "plasma" and "ether" are used to refer to combined effect of these fields. 

#### Nano coating
> A coating whose thickness is measured on the nano scale.  Nano coating is the result of an application where nano structures build a consistent network of molecules on a surface. 

#### GaNS
> Gas as a Nano State.  

#### Tin snips
> Snips, also known as shears, are hand tools used to cut sheet metal and other tough webs. There are two broad categories: tinner's snips, which are similar to common scissors, and compound-action snips, which use a compound leverage handle system to increase the mechanical advantage.

#### Caustic soda
> also known as lye. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is used in many industries, mostly as a strong chemical base in the manufacture of pulp and paper, textiles, drinking water, soaps and detergents and as a drain cleaner.

#### Distilled
> purify (a liquid) by heating it so that it vaporizes, then cooling and condensing the vapour and collecting the resulting liquid.
"they managed to distil a small quantity of water"

#### Voltmeter
> A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter.

#### Power Unit
> Keshe Foundation Magrav Power Unit.  A unit created from nanocoated copper wire (coils) and GaNS that when connected to a power source produce plasma energy.
