* Raw Materials
  - Anode (+): Nanocoated Copper plate
  - Cathode (-): Brass plate
  - Medium: 5 - 15% salinated water and container.  Make with distilled water and unprocessed salt crystals.
  - Wire to connect the two plates

To speed up harvest add a 1.5V (AA or AAA) battery in between the two plates.  Positive to copper and negative to brass (try the reverse, I did and still made GANS).  You will also need to pump air into the water to oxygenate it.  The resulting current flow will be a little too fast, hence the need for a fish tank pump.  If your GANS colour is orange/red then you need to pump air into the water.  If the GANS colour is green/blue then all is good!

For consitency you can regulate the current by adding a resistor in series. The optiumim current would be between 15-30mA (0.015 - 0.03A).  So using this formula:

Volts / Amps = Ohms (circut resistence + resistor size)

Where: 
* circut resistence = the resistence of your two plates in the saltwater
* resistor size     = the the size of resistor to buy from electronics shop (Jaycar for example)

Notes:  
* Use a multimeter on range 200 Ohms to check the resistence of your setup.
* Some assembly required including soldering so... yeah.
* The size of your plates and the distance they are apart mostly determine the resitance of your setup you could configure your setup so that it doesnt need a resistor.
